Paging is done by the Memory Managing Unit (MMU), which is part of the CPU on modern systems.

-> Segmentation transforms the logical address, directly used by the programmer, into a linear address
-> Paging (if enabled) turns the linear address in a physical address

This is achieved through 2 data structures:
- The page directory, in which each entry points to a page table. Its address is contained in the cr3 register.
- The page tables, in which each entry points to a physical address, corresponding to the start of a page.

-> A page directory entry is composed of:
   - the page table address, on 20 bits = 12 less significant bits of the 32-bit address must be set to 0
   - 3 bits available to use by the OS
   - The G bit, ignored
   - The S (Size) bit: 4 KiB pages if 0, 4 MiB pages if set to 1
   - A 0 bit, ignored
   - The A (Accessed) bit: the bit is set if a page has been read or written to, otherwise 0.
   - The D (cache Disable) bit: the page won't be cached if 1, otherwise it will be.
   - The W (Write-through) bit: write-through is enabled if 1, write-back if 0
     (See http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Write-through-write-around-write-back-Cache-explained).
   - The U (User/supervisor) bit: the page is accessible by all if 1, and only by the supervisor if 0.
   - The R (Read/write) bit: the page is read/write if 1, read-only if 0.
   - The P (Present) bit: the page is in physical memory at the moment if 1, 0 otherwise.
     If a page is not present and called, a page fault occurs and the OS has to handle it.
     When the P bit is not set, the other 31 bits can be used by the OS to store extra information, like
     where the page was put in swap memory for example.

-> A page table entry contains:
   - the page physical address, on 20 bits
   - 3 bits available to use by the OS
   - the G (Global) bit: the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB, see below) won't update the cr3 address
     in its cache if it is ever reset.
   - the D (Dirty) bit: the page has been written to if set, not if 0.
   - the C (Cache Disabled) bit: same as the D bit above.

The Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) is a memory cache that stores recent translations from virtual
memory to physical addresses, for faster retrieval.

Virtual memory is an OS feature that allows pages to be transferred from RAM to disk when RAM is full.
