16-bit registers: AX, BX, CX, DX, BP, SP, SI, DI, CS, DS, SS, ES and IP.

-> AX, BX, CX, DX, general purpose registers, can be adressed as 8-bit registers
   AX = AH (high 8-bit) + AL (low 8-bit)

-> BP (Base Pointer) - beginning of the stack

-> SP (Stack Pointer) contains a pointer to the current stack entry (top of the stack)

-> SI (Source Index) and DI (Destination Index) are used as dest/src index for string operations.
   See lodsb and movsb instructions

-> CS, DS, SS, ES are segment addresses registers (see note on memory addressing in real mode)

-> IP (Instruction Pointer) stores the offset of the next instruction to be executed.
   Associated with the Code Segment address register (as CS:IP), it gives the segmented address
   of the next instruction
