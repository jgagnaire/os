Four 16-bit segment registers:

   -> CS, current Code Segment
   -> DS, current Data Segment
   -> SS, current Stack Segment
   -> ES, Extra Segment (determined by the programmer)

Each segment has a maximal size of 65 536 bytes (max value of an unsigned 16-bit integer - 1)

The value stored in a segment register is interpreted as the first 16 bits of a 20-bit address
called a segment address, of which the least significant four bits are all zeros.

To get the linear address - same as the physical address in real mode - a 16-bit offset is added
to the segment address.

Example: segmented address 0x06EF:1234
-> segment selector of 0x06EF (value stored in the segment registers)
-> which gives us a 20-bit segment address of 0x06EF0 (the last 4-bit are zeros)
-> to which we add the offset 0x1234
-> so the linear address resulting is 0x06EF0 + 0x1234 = 0x08124

A linear address can thus be reached from different segment:offset pairs
Example: our linear address 0x08124 can have the segmented addresses:
-> 0x06EF:1234
-> 0x0812:0004
-> 0x0000:8124
etc...

A 20-bit linear address allows us to address 2^20 bytes = 1 MB max
